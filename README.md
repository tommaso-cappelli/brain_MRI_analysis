This projects consists in an AI agent developed to analyze MRI images of brains to uidentify the presence different types of brain cancer,
such as glioma, meninglioma or pitituary growths, after having compressed the original jpeg image in a greyscale. The directory contains all the 
materials to develop the machine, while the files the machine has been trained on can be found on Kaggle at this link:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset .
Remeber to modify the variable "dataset_path" in the first box to make sure the program
can access correctly the files from the database.
